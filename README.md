# Terminal-Configs

I find myself as I go through my academics in computer science living in the terminal more so than most GUI applications. So I created this repo for all my favoirite configurations! 

With all my terminal centric useage, I have even shifted to email and other neat things such as lynx and w3m. I find it easier not to get distracted with things while living in the temrinal! (It also makes me feel like more of a programmer lol...). I hope this repo can help you configure your terminal usage in the future as well! :) 

Note: I have taken a more non-GUI approach to how I use Linux as well as computing systems as a whole. I find it more of a nostalgic or more productive (besides web browsing lol..).

This repo includes configurations for (I will update this as I go along) 

- vim 
- neovim (I'm still getting the hang of this, not sure if I totally like this yet) 
- tmux (Coming soon)
- mutt (Coming soon)
